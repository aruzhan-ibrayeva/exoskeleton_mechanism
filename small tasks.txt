1. Check matrixes with the working and fix errors (in mechanism)
dyad_break condition is not met?
2. Understand the logic(using for loops/...)
3. dyad_break == 1 -> go to the next line
4. accessing a_0 and a_end
5. accessing boundaries & create variables...
6. generator values -> calculations using the boundaries
