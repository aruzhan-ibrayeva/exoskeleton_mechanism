# exoskeleton_mechanism

Generated extensive datasets (LPTAU), visualized(Matlab), and analyzed through scenario simulations, leading to enhanced mechanism performance: improved trajectory accuracy, efficient force transmission, and optimal exoskeleton foot design.
Python Development: Created a Python codebase, including custom algorithms, to insert, calculate, and extract data from animations, facilitating the quantification of the mechanism's performance. 
Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to integrate animated simulations into a broader project.
