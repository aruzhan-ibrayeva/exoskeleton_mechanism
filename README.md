# Exoskeleton Mechanism

## Project Description

This GitHub repository contains the Python codebase for the project titled "Structural-Parametric Synthesis of the Lower Limb Exoskeleton Mechanism." The codebase includes custom algorithms designed to insert, calculate, and extract data from animations, thereby enabling the quantitative analysis of the exoskeleton mechanism's performance.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to improve the performance of the lower limb exoskeleton mechanism by generating extensive datasets, visualizing them using Matplotlib, and conducting scenario simulations. The outcomes of this endeavor include enhanced trajectory accuracy, efficient force transmission, and an optimal exoskeleton foot design.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Generation:** The project involved the creation of extensive datasets, referred to as LPTAU (The results are in teh file "LPtau-Generator.xlsx"), which served as a foundation for performance analysis.

- **Visualization:** Matplotlib was used to visualize the generated data, aiding in the interpretation of the mechanism's behavior.

- **Scenario Simulations:** Scenario simulations were conducted to assess the performance of the exoskeleton mechanism in various real-world scenarios.

- **Python Development:** The project's codebase was developed using Python, which includes custom algorithms to manipulate animation data.

- **Multidisciplinary Collaboration:** The development process involved close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team to integrate animated simulations into a broader project.
